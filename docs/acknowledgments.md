 # Acknowledgments
 
**This guide is based almost entirely on _Malayalam: A University Course and Reference Grammar_ by Rodney F. Moag. Some modifications have been made to update the book and make it more web-friendly. The author's acknowledgments are reproduced below.**
 
I should like to hereby express my gratitude to all those who have helped bring this book in its several editions to reality. Firstly, thanks are due to The US Department of Education for the initial grant, which supported the writing of the first edition of this course, and to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor for hosting, the original project. Mrs. Julia Petrov of the U.S. Department of Education not only gave the benefit of her long experience in the application stage, but also maintained an interest in the project throughout the term of the grant. The first Edition was written over an 18-month period during 1979-80. Professors Tam Trautmann and Prof. L.A. Peter Gosling, co-directors of the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies at Michigan at that time, were most helpful in their moral support and in providing an administrative home for the project. Once funding for the proposal was granted, Gregory Vick of the U.S. Department of Education saw to the administrative details of the grant at the Washington end. The day-today administration of the project, including budget management, was handled by the principal investigator, but I received assistance in minor administrative matters from the office staff of the aforementioned Center and of the University of Michigan Linguistics Department.

In the preparation of the text itself, Rema Nair aided in the drafting of the first nine lessons. The texts for some of these first lessons were based in part an earlier Unpublished lessons, which the author had developed at the University of Missouri with the assistance of the late S. Velayudhan Asari.

Beginning with Lesson Ten, Thomas Joseph stepped in to take an increasingly important role in the work. He was able to compose dialogues and written texts, which were natural and still met the strict grammatical requirements of limited vocabulary and grammatical coverage, which I imposed. All of the translation exercises, the response exercises, and the grammatical drills for the earlier lessons represent the original work of the author, but all the grammar exercises for later lessons are the work of Thomas Joseph, He also revised and retranscribed the lengthy section an The Malayalam Writing System. Beyond all this, Joseph (who goes by Satish) often provided some curry, or some upma, along with South Indian coffee to restore the author's flagging energies at midday. Perhaps most important of all, he brought just the right combination of serious dedication and good-humored companionship to make the long hours of labor pass quickly and fruitfully.

Dr. John Vilanilam, a Professor of Journalism at the University of Kerala, carefully went through all of the Malayalam portions of the lessons in the first edition sending detailed and helpful comments which led to some revisions. Prof. James Lindholm and Dr. David McAlpin both well-known scholars of Dravidian languages, very graciously consented to serve as informal consultants an the project without remuneration. Their advice was especially helpful during the early work while refining the goals of the text and settling an a standard format for the lessons. My then graduate assistant, Larry Laffrey, assisted with the final stages of preparation of the manuscript of the first edition.

All of the grammar notes represent the author's original work, but I was aided both by daily consultations with Thomas Joseph and by occasional advice from the two informal consultants. Several published works on Malayalam were also consulted at various points, and some help was gleaned from them, though I did not always agree with their analysis in every detail. The author typed all of the English parts of the camera-ready copy of the first edition,
while Thomas Joseph wrote all of the Malayalam portions by hand.

All succeeding revisions have been produced at the University of Texas at Austin. The Index According to Grammatical Category was added in the 1986 edition. In succeeding editions, including the current one, revisions and additions to the grammar notes have benefited greatly from consultations with Dr. A.P. Andrewskutty, Professor of Linguistics at Kerala University who has given most generously of his time and insights during the author's half dozen research trips to Kerala in the intervening years.

A major improvement was realized in the third edition by digitizing the complete text forcomputer-generation. Entry into the computer was done by Robert Poletto and David Jacob in 1991-92 and by P.R. Shyamchandran in the summer of 1993. This work was supported by a U.S. Office of Education Materials Development Grant in 1990-91 and by generous support from the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Texas subsequently. The computer-based edition was made possible by the Malayalam font developed for the Macintosh by Dr. Lloyd Anderson of Ecological Linguistics of Washington D.C.  With the Third Edition in 1994 all of the Malayalam was converted to the new and somewhat simplified script for Malayalam mandated by the Government of Kerala.

The cover of the current edition was designed by H.P. "Hem" Ramachandran. I am also indebted to Sreedevi Nair for the cartographic work on the map of Kerala in Lesson 10.

The most recent revisions to the text were made with the assistance of Renju Jose during the summer of 2001. His computer skills, good-natured cooperation, and sensitivity to his native language made this portion of the work especially rewarding.

To all the aforementioned, and to all the students who have provided informal feedback through the 20 years of using the text in the classroom, as well as to those in many parts of the world who have used the text for self-study and sent their comments, my sincere thanks.

Any errors and shortcomings which remain in these pages are, of course, completely my responsibility and not that of those who assisted me.
