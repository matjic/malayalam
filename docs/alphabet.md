# Alphabet

## A note on pronunciation

Learning the sounds corresponding to each letter is important to be able to distinguish between words when listening and to pronounce words when speaking. 

Many distinct sounds in Malayalam would be considered variations of the same sound in English. For example, the retroflex ഡ (Da) and the dental ദ (da) would be equivalent. Also, അ (a) and ആ (aa) would be considered similar.

The order of the alphabet and sounds corresponding to each letter are similar across many Indian languages, including Hindi. This means that a video helping to pronounce Hindi letters is equally helpful in learning to pronounce Malayalam letters.



## Vowels

Vowels are referred to as **svaram (സ്വരം)** in Malayalam

| അ  	| ആ  	| ഇ  	| ഈ  	| ഉ   	| ഊ  	|
|----	|----	|----	|----	|-----	|----	|
| a  	| aa 	| i  	| ii 	| u   	| uu 	|


| ഋ  	| എ  	| ഏ  	| ഐ  	|
|----	|----	|----	|----	|
| ru 	| e  	| ee 	| ai 	|

| ഒ  	| ഓ  	| ഔ  	| അം 	| അഃ  	|
|----	|----	|----	|----	|-----	|
| o  	| oo 	| au 	| am 	| aha 	|

## Consonants

Consonants are referred to as **vyañjanam (വ്യഞ്ജനം)** in Malayalam

The names of the consonant groups are not used elsewhere in this guide and are simply given for reference. It may be helpful to look up the different groups to differentiate their pronunciations.

Keep in mind that the second and fourth consonants in each row from Velar to Labial are **aspirated** versions of the first and third sounds, respectively. For example, this means ഖ (kha) is the aspirated version of ക (ka) and ഘ (gha) is the aspirated version of ഗ (ga).

### Velar
| ക   	| ഖ   	| ഗ  	| ഘ   	| ങ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|
| ka  	| kha 	| ga 	| gha 	| nga 	|

### Postalveolar or Alveolo-palatal
| ച   	| ഛ   	| ജ  	| ഝ   	| ഞ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|
| ca  	| cha 	| ja 	| jha 	| ña  	|

### Retroflex

Pronounced with the tongue curled **backwards**

| ട   	| ഠ   	| ഡ  	| ഢ   	| ണ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|
| Ta  	| Tha 	| Da 	| Dha 	| Na  	|

### Dental

Pronounced with the tongue **against the back of upper teeth**

| ത     | ഥ     | ദ    | ധ     | ന\*   |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| ta    | tha   | da   | dha   | na    |

### Labial
| പ   	| ഫ   	| ബ  	| ഭ   	| മ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|
| pa  	| pha 	| ba 	| bha 	| ma  	|

### Other
| യ   	| ര   	| ല  	| വ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|
| ya  	| ra  	| la 	| va  	|

| ശ   	| ഷ   	| സ  	| ഹ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|
| sha 	| Sha 	| sa 	| ha  	|

| ള     | ഴ     | റ\** |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| La    | Ra    | ra   |

\* The syllable ന is pronounced in one of two ways, either as a dental consonant (with the tongue touching the teeth) or as an alveolar consonant (with the tongue behind the teeth)

\*\* When the syllable റ is doubled, appearing as ററ, then the resulting sound is pronounced as alveolar "ta" as in "teacher"

## Internal Vowel Symbols
അ is the default vowel for a consonant. The following symbols modify the consonant to have the corresponding vowel

| അ | ആ | ഇ | ഈ  | ഉ  | ഊ |
|---|---|---|----|----|---|
|   | ാ | ി | ീ  | ു   | ൂ  |

| ഋ | എ | ഏ | ഐ  |
|---|---|---|----|
| ൃ  | െ | േ | ൈ  |

| ഒ | ഓ | ഔ | അം | അഃ |
|---|---|---|----|----|
| ൊ | ോ | ൗ | ം  | ഃ  |

am (ം) is a particularly common vowel symbol and is referred to as an **anusvaram (അനുസ്വാരം)** in Malayalam or generally among Indian languages as an **anusvara**.

Examples with ക

| അ | ആ | ഇ | ഈ  | ഉ  | ഊ |
|---|---|---|----|----|---|
| ക  | കാ | കി | കീ  | കു   | കൂ  |

| ഋ | എ | ഏ | ഐ  |
|---|---|---|----|
| കൃ  | കെ | കേ | കൈ  |

| ഒ | ഓ | ഔ | അം | അഃ |
|---|---|---|----|----|
| കൊ | കോ | കൗ | കം  | കഃ  |

## Chillus

A **chillu** or a **chillaksharam (ചില്ലക്ഷരം)**, is a special consonant letter that represents a pure consonant independently, without help of an **echo vowel** (്).

For the first three of the consonants, the inherent vowel is suppressed by the addition of a "tail" as follows.

For last two of the consonants, the inherent vowel is suppressed through the use of a completely different character as follows.

| ണ | ന | ര | ല | ള |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ൺ | ൻ | ർ | ൽ | ൾ |

For all other consonants, the inherent vowel is suppressed by the use of the **echo vowel** (്), which is written at the upper right-hand corner of the consonant, as in the following examples: ക് ച് ട് ത് പ്.

This is also referred to in Malayalam as **chandrakkala (ചന്ദ്രക്കല)** or generally among Indian languages as a **virama**.


## Common Combined Consonants
Using the echo vowel (്), one can combine certain consonants together


### Double consonants
One type are the "double consonants" which are two of the same consonant combined together


| ക്‌ക | ങ്‌ങ | ച്‌ച | ത്‌ത | ട്‌ട |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| ക്ക    | ങ്ങ    | ച്ച    | ത്ത    | ട്ട    |

| ഞ്‌ഞ | ന്‌ന | ബ്‌ബ | മ്‌മ | യ്‌യ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| ഞ്ഞ    | ന്ന    | ബ്ബ    | മ്മ    | യ്യ    |


| ല്‌ല | വ്‌വ | പ്‌പ | ള്‌ള | ണ്‌ണ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| ല്ല    | വ്വ    | പ്പ    | ള്ള    | ണ്ണ     |

### Other combined consonants
Different consonants can be combined as well

| ഞ്‌ച | ണ്‌ട | ന്‌ത | മ്‌പ |
|----|----|----|----|
| ഞ്ച | ണ്ട | ന്ത | മ്പ |


### Combined consonants with more than two forms

| ന്‌റ | റ്‌റ |
|----|----|
| ന്റ | റ്റ |
| ൻറ | ററ |

Note that while ന്‌റ and ന്റ are pronounced **nta** while ന്‌റ can be pronounced either **nra** or **nta** depending on the word.

Similarly, റ്‌റ and റ്റ are pronounced **tta** while ററ is pronounced either **rara** or **tta** depending on the word.
