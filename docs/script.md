# The Malayalam Script

## A note on pronunciation

Learning the sounds corresponding to each letter is important to be able to distinguish between words when listening and to pronounce words when speaking. 

Many distinct sounds in Malayalam would be considered variations of the same sound in English. For example, the retroflex ഡ (Da) and the dental ദ (da) would be equivalent. Also, അ (a) and ആ (aa) would be considered similar.

The sounds corresponding to each letter are similar across many Indian languages, including Hindi. This means that a video helping to pronounce Hindi letters is equally helpful in learning to pronounce Malayalam letters.

## Consonants

The names of the consonant groups are not used elsewhere in this guide and are simply given for reference. It may be helpful to look up the different groups to differentiate their pronunciations.

Keep in mind that the second and fourth consonants in each row from Velar to Labial are **aspirated** versions of the first and third sounds, respectively. For example, this means ഖ (kha) is the aspirated version of ക (ka) and ഘ (gha) is the aspirated version of ഗ (ga).

### Velar
| ക   	| ഖ   	| ഗ  	| ഘ   	| ങ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|
| ka  	| kha 	| ga 	| gha 	| nga 	|

### Postalveolar or Alveolo-palatal
| ച   	| ഛ   	| ജ  	| ഝ   	| ഞ   	|

| ca  	| cha 	| ja 	| jha 	| ña  	|

### Retroflex

| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| ta    | tha   | da   | dha   | na    |

### Labial
| പ   	| ഫ   	| ബ  	| ഭ   	| മ   	|
|-----	|-----	|----	|-----	|-----	|

| ള     | ഴ     | റ\** |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| La    | Ra    | ra   |

\* The syllable ന is pronounced in one of two ways, either as a dental consonant (with the tongue touching the teeth) or as an alveolar consonant (with the tongue behind the teeth)

\*\* When the syllable റ is doubled, appearing as ററ, then the resulting sound is pronounced as alveolar "ta" as in "teacher"
